# Jeopardy1
 Source code for Jeopardy 1.0 (VB.NET WinForms)

Here's the source code to Jeopardy 1.0 which first started life about 2010 or so.
It's very primtive, written in Visual Basic.NET WinForms. All the clues are stored flat file as both a text file and a separate image file because I didn't know better at the time.

It also requires Visual Basic PowerPacks for the last correct response indicator, I think this was removed in Visual Studio 2012 (or 13?) but the DLL should still be in this source drop.

For best results run with two monitors with monitor 2 set to 1024x768.

You will also need the following fonts which have been removed for copyright reasons:

- Helvetica LT Compressed
- Korinna BT
- Swiss911 UCM BT

If you just want to play with binaries, check the Debug folder which should be a complete set of binaries, sound effects, and clues.

If you want to write your own clues for this version (why would you?) read the source code cause I've forgotten all of the special markers that determine if a clue is a daily double, audio, picture, or video clue.
